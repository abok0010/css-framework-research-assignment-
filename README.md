# css-framework-research-assignment

The framework I decided to choose for this assignment was the Accordion from Bootstrap. The CSS Accrodion is a menu made out of multiple containers in one that allows you to toggle information when clicked or interacted with. Its best used for pages on site with big information like FAQS, the questions could be stored on the top of the accordions while the answers can be hidden inside of the accordion and appear once clicked. 

If were to make a site and use an Accordion id use for the FAQs section of a page or on pages with lots of information to make it less intimidating for the user.
I installed the framework to my site and displayed in the middle of the page. All the information inside the Accordion is the default content that already is pre made in the framework.
